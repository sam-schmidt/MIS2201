                <h1 class="custom-header">Ciphers</h1>
                <p>Cipher: "a secret or disguised way of writing; a code". A cipher uses a set of rules, an algorithm, to turn normal text that can be read by humans, into a ciphertext, a seemingly random set of alphanumeric characters. Ciphers are most commonly used in cyber security. Ciphers are used to make different online protocols secure, such as: Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), Transport Layer Security (TLS), and to make HTTP secure, turning it into HTTPS.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I thought this was interesting because I had never really looked into the behind the scenes of cyber security. In a few courses, I had done very basic ciphers, such as ROT13 where you take a character and swap it with the 13th letter after the original character. Ciphers relate to MIS2201 because ciphers are the backbone of cyber security, and encryption as a whole.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The impact of ciphers affects everyone. At least everyone that uses the internet. Ciphers allow everyone that uses the internet to stay safe and secure. They allow our credit card numbers to stay hidden from attackers when making online purchases, and hide emails and passwords from attackers.</p>
